# panspermia

Panspermia is a "minimalist enough" set of Python scripts that let a user generate a galaxy that features a "tree of life" that spreads from planet to planet through natural and unnatural events.

Currently, I'm on Python 3.8.6. You may need to [pip install] Pygame and a handful of standard modules.

Usage:
./ps1.py [seed]

Right, controls are as follows:

  Spacebar: start and stop the simulation

  Mouse: To put it succinctly: "click things". Click stars and planets to look at them. Click on biomes and ecological features to filter the list of organisms. Click an organism to look at it. Click on the "asteroid" button on a planet to launch an asteroid. 

  The 's' key: take 1 simulation step

The terminal is going to output a lot of junk, which may or may not be interesting and is probably relevant to whatever I'm mostly working on at a given moment.
